## How to Contribute

You can contribute to Substrate by submitting PRs to modify the various Substrate object files within each directory, e.g.: `Problems`, `Solutions`, `Ideas`, etc.

We're working on a web-based interface for this as well to make it easier for non-coders to contribute.

> [!NOTE]
> July 27, 2024 — We moved to a single-repo structure to make the project easier to manage.
